## Logging

Our application uses NLog for logging, providing detailed tracking and diagnostics. Logs are categorized into levels: Trace, Debug, Info, Warning, Error, and Fatal. These logs are used to monitor the application's behavior and diagnose issues effectively.

### Levels Policy

- **Trace**: Used for detailed diagnostics and tracking the flow of the application. Disabled in production.
- **Debug**: Contains information useful for developers during debugging. Disabled in production.
- **Info**: General information about the application's workflow, such as successful operations. Used sparingly in production.
- **Warning**: Indicates potential issues that arenâ€™t immediately harmful but could lead to errors.
- **Error**: Logs when something has gone wrong but the application can continue running.
- **Fatal**: Critical issues that cause the application to terminate or stop working properly.

### Logging Setup

- **Initialization**: Call `LoggerConfig.ConfigureLogging()` at the start of the program (e.g., in `Program.cs`) to set up logging globally.
- **Shutdown**: Call `LogManager.Shutdown()` before the application exits to ensure all logs are flushed properly.

### Logging Useage

To use the logger, simply import and call it in your classes:

    using NLog;

    private static readonly Logger Logger = LogManager.GetCurrentClassLogger();

- To log a trace message: `Logger.Trace("Detailed trace message");`
- To log a debug message: `Logger.Debug("Debugging information");`
- To log an info message: `Logger.Info("General workflow message");`
- To log a warning: `Logger.Warn("Potential issue warning");`
- To log an error: `Logger.Error("Error encountered");`
- To log a fatal message: `Logger.Fatal("Critical issue");`

Once initialized the logger is available globally, including static classes.

### Log Configuration Using `appsettings`

Log Level Settings: You can configure log levels dynamically using the appsettings file. Example:

    // appsettings.dev.json
    {
        "ConnectionStrings": {
            "localhost": "Server=localhost;Database=db;User=user;Password=pass;"
        },
        "Log": {
            "FileLogLevel": "Trace", // Set the log level for file output
            "ConsoleLogLevel": "Info" // Set the log level for console output
        }
    }

Valid Levels are `Trace`, `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, `Error` and `Fatal`

Refer to `utils/LoggerConfig.cs` for detailed settings.
